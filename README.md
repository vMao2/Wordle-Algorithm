# About
This is in know way a complete algorithm and is not user friendly. It takes a complete list of possible wordle answers and assign points to each letter and finds the word with the most points. It runs in the python console.
## Dealing with similar words
If the word was skill and it had not elimated swill or shill, The algorithm will pick the word awake because is has the most letters that are unknown.
## Future plans
I might make a webapp, app, or both in the future to make it easier to use.
